  <h2>Maquinit</h2>
  <p>
  Maquinit is one of the very few saltwater hot springs in the world. Located along the southern coast of Busuanga Island, it is a one 30-minute tricycle ride away from the town proper of Coron along a rough, curvy road. It is said that the water gets heated by a volcano and springs up into the two-tiered circular pool. Its rough walls are built from stacks of rocks and its floors strewn with pebbles.

  <h2>Mount Tapyas</h2>
  <p>
  Mount Tapyas is the most popular viewpoint in Coron Town, Busuanga, with sweeping views over the rolling hills and a direct look towards the epic Coron Island in Palawan. The view doesn’t come easy though, to reach the giant cross at the summit, you need to climb 721 steps. In the piercing sun of Coron, this is a challenge that leaves many drenched in sweat and gasping for breath once they reach the top.

  <h2>Pulang Lupa</h2>
  <p>
  As the name suggests, the rocks that litter it’s grounds turn red during the rainy season but are brown during the dry season. In Pulang Lupa one is rendered speechless by the awesome view one witnesses the blue waters and numerous islands that surrounds the island. Currently the Pulang Lupa view deck is accessible only by four wheeled vehicles. The terrain is a bit rough specially after rains and it takes 15-20 minutes to get there. An exciting way to get there is by trekking which takes an hour and a half to two hours.

  <h2>Malcapuya Island</h2>
  <p>
  Malcapuya is a beautiful island that has powdery white shores and clear blue waters that will entice you to take a dip or go swimming. Beach-bumming, sunbathing or taking long walks are other things you can do. You have to rent an entire boat to visit Malcapuya and other spots near Culion, or you can join a tour in Coron as well.

  <h2>Banana Island</h2>
  <p>
  Banana island features a narrow strip of white sandy beach set against the backdrop of forested, hilly terrain near Culion and Coron. Moor your boat at a small lagoon in the shape of a horseshoe, find a hammock chair, and swing lazily, sheltered by the shade of tall palm trees. Several cottages on the island provide overnight accommodation, and the island also boasts a beach volleyball court. Bring your own food and beverages and watch out for the waves in the afternoon.
